	  <p>Open source as a development model promotes a universal access via a free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint, including subsequent improvements to it by anyone. Opening the source code enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models, communication paths, and interactive communities.
At Konstruct 2015 we the students of WBUT have endeavored to capture this spirit by bringing together stalwarts in the field of OSS like Mozilla, Linux Users Group, and Java Users Group. NULL is well known internationally acclaimed non-profit "open_Information_security_community", where Hackers, Infosec Professionals, Security Enthusiast get the open arena to share their knowledge and can discuss the latest trends on vulnerabilities, exploits and security risks. The Pre-null meet at Konstruct 2015 is organised so that fully operational kolkata chapter of NULL can be started. As Kolkata's first Open Source Fest kicks off the great words of Linus Torvalds once again comes to mind:
"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."
Enjoy!</p>
